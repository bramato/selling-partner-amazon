## Installation

composer require bramatom/selling-partner-amazon
```

## Usage
### AmazonMarketplace
The AmazonMarketPlace class represents an Amazon marketplace.

The class constructor accepts a marketplace ID as a parameter and uses the AmazonMarketplaceData::getById method to retrieve the marketplace data from the database. If the data is found, the class fields are set with the retrieved data, otherwise the error field is set to true.

The class includes the following public methods:

- getId: returns the ID of the marketplace
- getName: returns the name of the marketplace
- getZone: returns the zone of the marketplace
- getEndpoint: returns the endpoint of the marketplace

```php
$marketplace = new AmazonMarketPlace(AmazonMarketplaceId::NORTH_AMERICA);

if ($marketplace->error) {
    // handle error
} else {
    echo 'ID: ' . $marketplace->getId() . "\n";
    echo 'Name: ' . $marketplace->getName() . "\n";
    echo 'Zone: ' . $marketplace->getZone() . "\n";
    echo 'Endpoint: ' . $marketplace->getEndpoint() . "\n";
}

```
